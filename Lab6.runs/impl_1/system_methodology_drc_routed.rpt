2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2__1 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2__2 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#5 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2__3 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#6 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at vga/vga_sync_unit/video2__4 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.987 ns between vga/vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and vga/vga_sync_unit/video_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Hsync relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on RsTx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Vsync relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
